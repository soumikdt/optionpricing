# Barrier Option Simulation

## Overview

This project simulates the pricing of a **barrier option**, a type of financial derivative. The code provides functionality to simulate the option price using Monte Carlo methods, incorporating a barrier condition, and calculates various statistical metrics for the results.

---

## Features

- Simulates stock price paths using the **Box-Muller method** for Gaussian random number generation.
- Computes the payoff of the barrier option if the barrier is activated.
- Calculates:
  - Average payoff (undiscounted)
  - Present value of the payoff (discounted)
  - Standard deviation of the discounted payoff
- Prints simulation parameters and results for better understanding.
